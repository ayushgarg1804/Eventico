Under the expert baton of\u00a0David Hill, Yale and Juilliard will combine forces to perform\u00a0J.S. Bach\u2019s first major liturgical composition on a Latin text, the\u00a0Magnificat in D Major, as well as a brand new commission from Indian-American composer\u00a0Reena Esmail,\u00a0This Love Between Us: Prayers for Unity.\nA graduate of both Yale and Juilliard\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving studied with two composers commissioned by Classical Movements\u2019\u00a0Eric Daniel Helms New Music Program, Christopher Rouse and Christopher Theofanidis, respectively\u200a\u2014\u200aEsmail\u2019s beguiling, East-meets-West work explores seven religions (Buddhism, Sikh, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism, Islam) through seven scriptures (Danda Vagga,\u00a0Guru Granth Sahib, the\u00a0Bible,\u00a0Pahlavi Rivayat,\u00a0Isha Upanishad\u00a0and the poet Kabir,\u00a0Acharanga Sutra, Rumi\u2019s poetry) in eight different languages: Sanskrit, Punjabi, Malayalam, ancient Persian, Hindi, Prakrit, Arabic and English.\n\u201cThis Love Between Us\u2026\u00a0draws from each religious tradition\u2019s teachings on unity,\u201d says Esmail. \u201cI\u2019ve consulted 22 people to get to this point in the text and music, and it\u2019s the most ambitious text I\u2019ve ever compiled, between the subject and the languages. There are religious scholars, poetic scholars, speakers of each of these languages who have coached me in diction and pronunciation. It has been an incredible experience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, Juilliard415 will perform\u00a0Storms and Demons: Dances from the Operas of\u00a0Jean-Philippe Rameau, an evocative instrumental suite culled from one of the most elegant composers of 18th-century France.\nFounded by Simon Carrington in 2003,\u00a0Yale Schola Cantorum\u00a0is a chamber choir that performs sacred music from the 16th century to the present day in concert settings and choral services around the world. Conducted by David Hill, with Masaaki Suzuki serving as principal guest conductor, YSC is sponsored by Yale University\u2019s Institute of Sacred Music. Open by audition to students from all departments and professional schools across the university, the ensemble has a special interest in collaborative, historically-informed performance practice, most often with instrumentalists from Juilliard415.\nRecent concerts have heard Yale Schola Cantorum under the direction of internationally renowned conductors such as Matthew Halls, Simon Halsey, Paul Hillier, Stephen Layton, Sir Neville Marriner, Nicholas McGegan, James O\u2019Donnell, Stefan Parkman, Krzysztof Penderecki, Helmuth Rilling and Dale Warland. Performing regularly in New Haven, Connecticut and New York City, the ensemble tours and records, both nationally and internationally.\nYSC\u2019s live recording of Heinrich Biber\u2019s 1693\u00a0Vesperae longiores ac breviores\u00a0with Robert Mealy and Yale Collegium Musicum received international acclaim from the early music press, as have subsequent CDs of Bach\u2019s rarely heard, 1725 version of\u00a0St. John Passion\u00a0and Antonio Bertali\u2019s\u00a0Missa resurrectionis.\u00a0A commercial recording on the Naxos label of the Mendelssohn and Bach\u00a0Magnificats\u00a0was released in 2009. More recent releases include two albums from Delos Records, and recordings of Brahms, Faur\u00e9, Palestrina and Roderick Williams are forthcoming. On tour, Schola Cantorum has given performances in England, Hungary, France, China, South Korea, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Japan, Singapore, Russia, Estonia and Latvia.\nHighlights of YSC\u2019s 2016\u201317 season at home include: a chamber version of the Brahms\u00a0Requiem\u00a0with maestro Hill; music of mourning from Dresden with maestro Suzuki; premieres of works by Tawnie Olsen and Hannah Lash; Handel\u2019s\u00a0Occasional Oratorio.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its founding in 2009,\u00a0Juilliard415, the school\u2019s principal period-instrument ensemble, has made significant contributions to the musical life of New York and beyond, bringing major figures in the field of early music to lead performances of both rare and canonical works of the 17th and 18th centuries. Among the many distinguished guests who have led 415 are William Christie, Ton Koopman, Harry Bicket, Nicholas McGegan, Christopher Hogwood, Jordi Savall, Lars Ulrik Mortensen and Monica Huggett. In 2011, the ensemble made its Carnegie Hall debut, accompanying David Daniels and Dorothea R\u00f6schmann in a program of Handel arias\u200a\u2014\u200aa concert the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0called one of the season\u2019s best. 415\u2019s performance of Handel\u2019s\u00a0Il Trionfo del Tempo, led by maestro Christie, earned this same distinction in 2012.\nTogether with Juilliard\u2019s Marcus Institute for Vocal Arts, every year, 415 presents fully-staged operas and full-scale oratorios. Recent offerings include Handel\u2019s\u00a0Radamisto, Purcell\u2019s\u00a0Dido and Aeneas, both\u00a0Passions\u00a0and the\u00a0Magnificat\u00a0of Bach and Cavalli\u2019s\u00a0La Calisto. Recently, in a joint venture with the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s Lindemann Young Artist Development Program, Jane Glover conducted 415 in Gluck\u2019s\u00a0Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide.\nTouring extensively nationally and internationally, too, 415 has performed all along the East Coast and throughout Italy, Japan, Southeast Asia and the U.K., where a concert with its closest musical partner, the Yale Institute of Sacred Music, was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3. Other 2016\u201317 tours find the group in Holland with the Royal Conservatoire of the Hague for Bach\u2019s\u00a0Mass in B minor, Ton Koopman conducting, and in New Zealand with Bach specialist Masaaki Suzuki for a 10-concert span.\nDomestic highlights of 415\u2019s 2016\u201317 include: a celebration of the Italian concerto led by Rachel Podger on the \u201cMusic Before 1800\u201d series; symphonies of Haydn with maestra Huggett; fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout leading Mozart symphonies and concerti; an all-Rameau program with William Christie and Paul Agnew; Handel\u2019s\u00a0Agrippina, conducted by Laurence Cummings in his Juilliard debut.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Hill\u00a0has a long and distinguished career as one of the leading conductors in Europe. His talent has been recognized by appointments as chief conductor of the BBC Singers, musical director of the Bach Choir, chief conductor of the Southern Sinfonia, music director of Leeds Philharmonic Society and associate guest conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In 2002, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Southampton, in recognition of his services to music. In 2007, he received an honorary fellowship of the Royal School of Church Music, and in 2010 an honorary membership to the Royal Academy of Music.\nPreviously, Hill was Master of the Music at Winchester and Westminster Cathedrals, music director of the Waynflete Singers, artistic director of the Philharmonia Chorus and director of music at St. John\u2019s College, Cambridge. Guest conducting credits include many of Europe\u2019s well-known ensembles: London Philharmonic, English Chamber Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Netherlands Radio Choir and RIAS Kammerchor, Berlin. David Hill also maintains an active career as organist and pianist in recitals worldwide.\nWith over 100 recordings to his credit, from Gregorian chant to Renaissance polyphony, from baroque oratorios to modern masterpieces for chorus and orchestra, Hill has performed virtually every style and period in the choral repertoire. He has commissioned dozens of works from leading composers of today, including Judith Bingham, Francis Pott, Patrick Gowers, Sir John Tavener, Philip Wilby and Jonathan Dove. At Yale, Hill serves as principal conductor of Yale Schola Cantorum and participates in the training of choral conducting majors with Marguerite L. Brooks and Jeffrey Douma.\n\n\n\n\n\nReena Esmail\u00a0enjoys working in both the Western and Hindustani (North Indian) classical music idioms. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in composition from the Juilliard School and a master\u2019s degree from the Yale School of Music, where her primary teachers have included Aaron Jay Kernis, Christopher Theofanidis, Martin Bresnick, Christopher Rouse and Samuel Adler. Esmail has won numerous awards, including the Walter Hinrichsen Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (with forthcoming publication of a work by C.F. Peters) and two ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composer Awards. She is currently a post-residential doctoral candidate at the Yale School of Music.\nAs the recipient of a 2011\u201312 Fulbright-Nehru grant, Esmail studied Hindustani vocal music in New Delhi, India and was selected to speak about her work at the INK/TED Conference in Jaipur, with additional speaking engagements in Chennai, Delhi and Goa. For the 2010\u201311 season, she was the conductor and arranger for Yale\u2019s Hindi\u00a0a cappella\u00a0group, Sur et Veritaal. Esmail\u2019s doctoral thesis, \u201cFinding Common Ground: Uniting Practices in Hindustani and Western Art Musicians,\u201d explores the methods and challenges of that collaborative process.

Registrations are now open. Head to\u00a0http://clashhacks.in/ to register yourself for the event.\nClash Hacks is going to be India's largest student-run independent hackathon which is coming to town on March 25th, 2017. It is bound to witness a stupendous set of developers from all over the nation battling it out for glory and amazing hackathon swag. An entirely independent event, Clash Hacks expects a wholehearted support from the open source and tech related world in order to be able to meet expectations of the affiliate members of the hackathon culture.\nWe pride ourselves on building a technical community at the national level with work outsourced to multiple streams across the country, which makes it India's largest student-run independent hackathon. It consists of everything that happens in a hackathon with the twist being a whole-new interactive clash concept where contender teams can request for a show of a certain feature during the demonstration of the project. We will make sure to intrigue you in the most interesting way possible.\nHOW DOES IT WORK? / EVENT STRUCTURE\n-> Step 1 - Shortlisting of participants to get best 200 developers of the\u00a0country. ClashHacks interests a variety of developers at all levels of skills across the country. This enthusiasm is shared by many who wish to develop the tech that leads to the world of tomorrow. The goal is to maintain a competitive environment while giving chances to new developers to test out their skills against the experienced developers whom can provide a challenging aura in a healthy and fast paced environment. Creating such a platform requires us to shortlist the candidate list by some margin. ClashHacks proceeds into the competition with selected best 200 developers among the applied candidates to an all-out coding war.\n-> Step 2 - Team building and ice breaking sessions. Have your own team? Awesome. Are you a lone wolf? Cool. Couldn\u2019t find the right partners yet? Don\u2019t worry, before the competition starts you can team up with other singular entries to make a team. The teams announce themselves so that the clashing can begin. \n-> Step 3 - Shortlisting best 10 teams for stage presentation by pre-evaluation. The core team will evaluate the 10 best teams who shall be eligible for presentation of their product in front of the panel of judges.

Registrations are now open. Head to\u00a0http://clashhacks.in/ to register yourself for the event.</STRONG></H2>\n<P>Clash Hacks is going to be India's largest student-run independent hackathon which is coming to town on March 25th, 2017. It is bound to witness a stupendous set of developers from all over the nation battling it out for glory and amazing hackathon swag. An entirely independent event, Clash Hacks expects a wholehearted support from the open source and tech related world in order to be able to meet expectations of the affiliate members of the hackathon culture.<BR></P>\n<P>We pride ourselves on building a technical community at the national level with work outsourced to multiple streams across the country, which makes it India's largest student-run independent hackathon. It consists of everything that happens in a hackathon with the twist being a whole-new interactive clash concept where contender teams can request for a show of a certain feature during the demonstration of the project. We will make sure to intrigue you in the most interesting way possible.<BR><STRONG></STRONG></P>\n<P><STRONG>HOW DOES IT WORK? / EVENT STRUCTURE</STRONG><BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>-&gt; Step 1</STRONG> - Shortlisting of participants to get best 200 developers of the\u00a0country. ClashHacks interests a variety of developers at all levels of skills across the country. This enthusiasm is shared by many who wish to develop the tech that leads to the world of tomorrow. The goal is to maintain a competitive environment while giving chances to new developers to test out their skills against the experienced developers whom can provide a challenging aura in a healthy and fast paced environment. Creating such a platform requires us to shortlist the candidate list by some margin. ClashHacks proceeds into the competition with selected best 200 developers among the applied candidates to an all-out coding war.<BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>-&gt; Step 2</STRONG> - Team building and ice breaking sessions. Have your own team? Awesome. Are you a lone wolf? Cool. Couldn\u2019t find the right partners yet? Don\u2019t worry, before the competition starts you can team up with other singular entries to make a team. The teams announce themselves so that the clashing can begin. <BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>-&gt; Step 3</STRONG> - Shortlisting best 10 teams for stage presentation by pre-evaluation. The core team will evaluate the 10 best teams who shall be eligible for presentation of their product in front of the panel of judges. The judges decide the winners after each selected team has presented their project. The pre-evaluation as well as the judge\u2019s decisions are final and shall not be changed because ClashHacks is nothing if not fair. <BR></P>\n<P><STRONG>-&gt; Step 4</STRONG> - announcing category wise and overall winners.

I am talking about something that is unique to you as an individual, which no one else has.\u00a0\nThink of Steve Jobs for a second and his love for Technology & Beauty. By following that love of his he became the most successful entrepreneur there ever was. But what's also important to notice is, that the people who followed his footsteps and tried to replicate what he did always remained in Second place or worse.\u00a0\nWhy is that?\u00a0\nEach individual is born with a natural affinity to bring to life what is unique to them. You could be a singer, a dancer, an entrepreneur or even a stay at home mom. It doesn't matter, you have a unique talent that is waiting to be brought to life.\nWhat stops you?\nYou do! You unwillingly get in your own way. When you take action in your life based on your fear, anger and/or depression you compromise the goal you are going for. This can be seen when you go for something that is of high importance to you. For example: When you freeze in a job interview, the feeling of anxiety that you get in your stomach that numbs your brain; or The rage you feel when you belittle someone, who didn't do what you asked them to; or The depression you feel when you have been rejected for that big job you always wanted...etc you get my point\nCan you do anything to stop all of these unwanted negative feelings?\u00a0\nNo, absolutely not. The more you try to avoid them, the more they overpower you. No one has ever won a fight with their own demons (your negative feelings and emotions)\nSo what do you do?\u00a0\nWhat you don't know is that you can harness these fears, anxieties, and frustrations as fuel to reach your goals. \u00a0But today, in our society, rather than harnessing them we are told to demonize them as if it's wrong to feel like that. In this webinar I will show you what you can do, with simple exercises and examples, to harness them and create powerful results.\u00a0\nWhat is this webinar not about/about?\nThis webinar is not about 'The Law of Attraction' or NLP or related modules. It is not your regular personal development module either where it works for some and not for the rest. What I will share with you are fundamental premises that will help you illuminate your unique path to success.\u00a0\n\nIf you are skeptical and think that this will be like any other personal development lecture...well just show up.\nIf you think you won't be able to make it on that time, just sign up anyway and I will send you the link of the recording.\u00a0\nThis webinar will be short and to the point. This is not a click bait webinar, I won't go on rambling about a product of mine for the one hour. I will actually give you tools and techniques that you will immediately be able to put into practice.\u00a0\n\nCOMPETITION!!!\nTo give back something to you guys for participating in the webinar, I am giving away a free ebook. It will be about all the premises that I will cover and won't cover in this webinar.\u00a0\nTo Participate:\n1.
