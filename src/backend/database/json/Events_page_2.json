They don\u2019t require drilling into the roof, and the bracings used in standard ground mount systems are lightweight and easy to remove\nA ground-mounted solar array can be more productive per panel than a rooftop solar array. The panels are set at the perfect angle to optimize energy production, which means it can generate more electricity than a comparably sized rooftop system and save money in the long run\nGround-mounted solar is very easy to access for cleaning and maintenance\n\n\nBattery storage\n\nBy 2020, about 11.3 gigawatts of energy storage will be installed globally, equivalent to less than one percent of the total installed capacity of intermittent renewables, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance\nBattery storage to play an important role in India\u2019s sustainable energy future\nWith limited investments in research and development of low cost and efficient battery technologies, the cost of batteries remain high resulting in less commercialization, poor adoption of battery storage. Pumped storage hydro power continues to dominate the energy storage in India\nMake in India initiative to manufacture cost effective batteries\nThe state-run Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) is seeking bids for a 750-megawatt solar park at Ananthapuramu in Andhra Pradesh. In order to supplement the massive series of projects, SECI is looking to procure 100 megawatts of storage capacity\nOver US$ 1.3 billion annual battery storage market in India\n\n\nSolar cities\n\nDevelopment of 60 solar cities and 33 solar parks\nMetros, airports and railway stations implementing solar projects\nDayal Singh College in Delhi installed solar panels for the electricity requirement of the college and the vicinity\nThe CREDA will be setting upto 1KV capacity solar power plant in all govt. schools, panchayat buildings and Anganwadis in Chhatisgarh\nIn a first of its kind in Central India solar power plant installed on a floating platform at Vidarbha Industries Power Ltd (VIPL), at Butibori, is being seen as a major advance with multiple advantages\nGreater Chennai Corporation will install solar panels on the rooftops of 130 buildings as part of phase-two expansion of the project to tap renewable energy to power the local body's offices\n\n\nSmart villages\n\nCensus 2011 data shows the inequalities in basic amenities between rural and urban India:\n\n\u00a0While 93% of urban households have electricity, only 55% of rural households have it\nWhile 71% of urban households have access to piped water connections, the figure is only 35% for rural households\nOnly 31% of rural households have access to toilets, while 81% of urban households have latrines\n\nPrime Minister Modi launches mission aimed at turning rural areas into economically, socially and physically sustainable spaces. Launched the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) aimed at making villages smart and growth centres of the nation.\nDevelop around 2,500 Smart Villages by 2019, incorporating solar pumps for irrigation, solar water heaters, solar panels connected with batteries for home lighting and street lighting, etc\nRurban Mission launched by the Government recently (beginning from a small tribal cluster of Chhattisgarh) aims to bring together 5-7 villages into a cluster with population of 25,000 people. It will be then developed on all fronts like a city with economic standards, electricity, health and education facilities and employment opportunities for locals.\nOdisha government plans to develop 50 MW canal bank solar projects by 2022\nUnder Green development initiative two Andhra villages- Toorputallu and Pedhamyanavanilanka will be electrified completely on solar power\nUnder DDUGJY-RE, Ministry of Power has sanctioned 921 projects to electrify 1,21,225 un-electrified villages, intensive electrification of 5,92,979 partially electrified villages and provide free electricity connections to 397.45 lakh BPL rural households\n\n\nMicro grids\n\nMicro grid as a concept may be young, but it holds the key to lighting and digitally connecting millions of lives\nThe notation of micro grids came from the availability of renewable power and due to demand of electricity from remote areas\n\u00a0These are grid-independent self-sufficient grids in remote areas where one uses diesel together with renewable energy to generate power for a targeted population\nA micro grid comprised power generation system, energy storage facility and the load management system. Micro grid of 2-3 MW capacity could cater to 5,000 households\n\n\nStreet lighting\n\nThe Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) is laying down standards for all stakeholders of street lighting, which involves use of efficient lamp technologies, optimization of pole and placement, efficient light distribution that balances the need for light and visibility\nSolar LED street lighting is an especially cost-effective solution for parking lots, parks, residential streets, airports, and other applications where providing electricity is expensive or problematic\nSolar street lights require much less maintenance compared to conventional street lights.\nUPNEDA (Uttar Pradesh New &Amp Renewable Energy Development Agency) has set up about 1.25 lakh solar energy based street lighting plants till date under the street lighting program\nEnergisation of Street Lights with Solar Power is a State funded scheme of Tamil Nadu under which solar powered street lights were installed in 1,000 Village Panchayats investing a sum of Rs.52.50 crore for energisation of 20,000 street over a period of 5 years from 2011-12\n\n\nEnergy efficient products\n\nConsumer Products: solar water heating systems; Solar home lighting systems; solar lanterns; solar pumps; solar mobile chargers; solar cookers; LED solar torch; solar RO plant; solar fan, solar Inverters, etc.\nCommercial Products: Solar traffic signals; solar road studs/blinkers, etc.\n\n\nGovernment initiatives\n\nIndia has added a total of 2,311.88 MW of grid-connected power generation capacity from renewable energy sources like solar and wind this fiscal in the country.\nThe Government of India has up-scaled the target of renewable energy capacity to 175 GW by the year 2022.

Furthermore, India ranks 133rd out of 180 nations for its water availability and 120th out of 122 nations for its water quality. It has been evaluated that 80 percent of India\u2019s surface is polluted which results in India losing US$ 6 billion every year due to water-related diseases. Challenges faced by the Indian water sector are due to increasing water consumption and wastage in urban areas, water-borne diseases, industrial growth, political and regulatory disputes, water cycle imbalances, increasing irrigation and agricultural demand, lack of technology, etc. According to estimates, India\u2019s water sector requires investment worth US$ 13 billion.  The 4th Water India 2017 expo is an important platform created to show case products, services and solutions available in the water industry worldwide.  The event will provide comprehensive insight into the water industry\u2013best practices, latest technologies, alternative solutions, emerging opportunity and business prospective.\n\nKey segments of 4th Water India 2017 expo\n\nSupply & distribution\n\nIndia is facing water crisis which is expected to worsen as the overall population is expected to increase to 1.6 billion by year 2050\nAccording to Central Water Commission (CWC) report, water levels in 91 major reservoirs in the country are at just 25% of capacity\u201430% lower than last year, and 25% less than the average storage in a decade\nReservoirs in India\u2019s eastern and central regions have the most water, with levels at 44 per cent and 36 per cent, respectively, of capacity; while levels in the south, west and north are 20 per cent, 26 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively, according to the CWC data\n10-year average for water levels in the country is 38.5 per cent\nRs 15,260 crore ($2.77 billion) has been allocated to the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation to expand and improve drinking water supply in the country\n\n\nPotable drinking water\n\nIn the urban areas though about 60% of the population is depended on surface water sources, the availability and quality are questionable\nRural India lives in about 1.7 million habitations (including villages), three-quarters of which - 1.3 million - gets 40 liters of water per person per day for all uses, including drinking and other usage like bathing, washing clothes, utensils and sanitation\nThere are 66,093 rural habitations in India where the drinking-water source is contaminated with either one or more chemicals, such as arsenic, fluoride, nitrate, iron and salinity; although this is down from 84,292 over two years (Source: IndiaSpend report)\nIt is estimated that around 37.7 million Indians are affected by waterborne diseases annually, 1.5 million children are estimated to die of diarrhea alone and 73 million working days are lost due to waterborne disease each year\n\n\nIrrigation system\n\nIrrigation refers to the supplying water to the dry land as a supplementation of rain water\nAbout 68% of the area equipped for irrigation is located in Asia, 17% in the Americas, 9% in Europe, 5% in Africa and 1% in Oceania\nMajor aim of irrigation systems is to help out in growing of agricultural crops and vegetation by maintaining the minimum amount of water required\nApart from crop production, it helps in protecting plants against frost, suppressing wild plant growing in grain fields and helping to avert soil consolidation\n\u00a0Irrigation systems are also used for dust repression, removal of sewage, and in mining\nTypes of irrigation systems \n\nSurface irrigation - Uncontrolled (or wild or free) flooding method - Border strip method - Check method - Basin method - Furrow method\nSubsurface irrigation\nSprinkler irrigation\nTrickle(Drip) irrigation\n\n\n\n\nWater storage systems\n\nIndia's per capita water storage capacity currently is much below that of China or the United States\nMore than 60 percent of India\u2019s irrigated agriculture and 85 percent of drinking water supplies are dependent on groundwater\nWater is stored in natural water sources, such as\u00a0groundwater aquifers,\u00a0soil waterand natural\u00a0wetlands\nIt is also stored in small artificial\u00a0ponds, tanks\u00a0and\u00a0reservoirs behind major dams\nWater recharge/storage/conservation\u00a0practices from past and present \n\nSurface irrigation\nKatta\nSand Bores\nJohads\nBawdi/Jhalara\nBamboo Drip Irrigation\n\n\n\n\nWastewater treatment\n\n80 percent of India\u2019s surface water is polluted\n75 percent of water pollution is from domestic sewage, which is discharged untreated into local water bodies \n\nGrey water is the domestic wastewater from bathrooms (such as basins, showers and baths), laundry fixtures (such as clothes washing machines and laundry troughs) and kitchen facilities (such as sinks and dishwashing machines)\nBlack water refers to wastewater that contains human waste. Black water is collected through toilets and urinals\n\n\nOnly 31 percent of urban wastewater is treated per day at 11,787 million litres per day (MLD)\nThe total wastewater generated by the 299 class I cities is 16,662 MLD.\u00a0 Out of 299 class I cities, 160 cities have sewerage coverage for more than 75% of the population and 92 cities have between 50 and 75% of population coverage\nIndia's total water and wastewater treatment market alone is worth about $420m, growing annually by about 18%\n\n\nSewage treatment\n\nOnly 37 percent of urban sewage is treated per day at 23,277 million litres per day (MLD)\nOut of 816 municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) listed across India (522 are operational, 79 STPs don\u2019t work, 145 are under construction, and 70 are proposed)\nOn the whole 70% of the population of class I cities are provided with sewerage facility\nDelhi has the maximum treatment capacity that is 2330 MLD (30% of the total treatment capacity of metropolitan cities)\n\u00a0Next to Delhi, Mumbai has the capacity of 2130 MLD, which is 26% of total capacity in metropolitan cities\n\n\nHazardous waste\n\nHazardous waste is waste that poses substantial or potential threats to public health or the environment\nAccording to the Central Pollution Control Board, total hazardous waste generation in India in 2015 was 7.46 million metric tonnes from about 44,000 industries\nAccording to a report by Centre for Science & Environment, the entire country has nitrate levels higher than the prescribed levels\u2014a result of sewage leaching into groundwater supplies\n\n\nImproper hazardous-waste storage or disposal frequently contaminates surface and groundwater supplies\nDumps and landfills are a threat to water supplies when water percolates through waste\n\n\nWater sustainability / harvesting / conservation\n\nThere are various methods of water conservations, including; rainwater harvesting, water recycling, reducing water demand in agriculture sector (efficiency of water use, reducing its loss due to evaporation, improving soil moisture through various techniques like mulching, contour farming, drip irrigation, desalination, etc.)\nRainwater harvesting (RWH) is the practice of collecting, storing and distributing rainwater to use it as an alternative source of water \n\nGlobal rainwater harvesting market will witness a CAGR of 4.8% during the period 2016-2020\n\n\nWater recycling is reusing treated wastewater. Water recycling helps to further reclaim water\n\nKuwait, Israel, Singapore and Egypt are leading with 91%, 85%, 35% and 32% of its wastewater reuse, respectively.\nWater reuse market holds huge opportunity in India where the water recycling rate is less than 20%.\nCapital expenditure on water reuse is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.5% while the global installed capacity of high quality water reuse plants is expected to grow from 28 million cubic meters per day to 79 million cubic meters per day\n\nDesalination is an energy-intensive process where salt and other minerals are removed from sea water to produce potable water for drinking and irrigation. \n\nTwo of India's most industrialised states, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, are the keen to use desalination technology\n\n\nWaterless toilets \n\nOn an average 8,300 litres of potable water is consumed in a month by a conventional urinal\nMore than 53 percent of Indian homes \u2014 about 70 percent in the villages lack toilets. Poor sanitation and contaminated water cause 80 percent of the diseases afflicting rural India\nThe cost incurred per month actually works out to nearly Rs 2500 per urinal whereas the cost of these waterless installations is just about Rs 5000\nThe average savings per urinal pot including the water\u00a0 is Rs 30,000 per year\nWaterless toilets can be effective for rural India, targeting mainly the farming community with the basic premise that there is dearth of water in most rural areas\n\n\n\n\nSolar powered water supply\n\nA solar-powered pump is a pump running on electricity generated by photovoltaic panels or the radiated thermal energy available from collected sunlight as opposed to grid electricity or diesel run water pumps\nSolar-based dual pump pipe water supply scheme is a viable solution\u00a0where development of drinking water supply infrastructure is not feasible in inaccessible areas and places having no natural water sources\nSolar-powered water pumps can deliver drinking water as well as water for livestock or irrigation purposes\nThe advantages of using solar-powered pump are:\n\nLow cost\n\u00a0Do not depend upon electricity \u2013 Solar power\n\u00a0Easy to operate and maintain\n\u00a0Low recurring costs \u2013 No electricity charges\nWater available throughout the day in houses/at doorsteps\nWater is supplied right upto houses by taps\n\u00a0Works even on rainy/cloudy days\n\nBy 2016, a total of 1,00,000 solar PV water pumping systems will be installed in India\n\n\nHydropower\n\nIndia\u00a0is the 7th largest producer of hydroelectric power\nThe proposed hydro capacity addition during the 12th Plan period is 10,897 MW. However, up to December 2015, the actual capacity addition is only 3,651.02 MW which is 33.5 per cent of the proposed capacity addition, according to data by\u00a0Central Electricity Authority\u00a0(CEA)\nIndia imports surplus hydro power from Bhutan. The\u00a0hydro-electric power\u00a0plants at Darjeeling\u00a0and\u00a0Shivanasamudra\u00a0are among the first hydro-electric power plants in Asia\nThe public sector has a predominant share of 92.5% in hydro sector\nPrivate sector owns nearly 7.5% out of the total 42,783 MW but this sector is going to growing fast\n\n\nResearch and development\n\nIndian\u00a0water market is $ 30 billion sized\nKey focus areas: equipment supply, public private partnerships for water supply and distribution, water treatment plants and water EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) business and integrated water resource management for utilities\nMaharashtra is emerging as a hub for the water sector\n\nOver 12 international companies have already set up design and engineering centers in Mumbai and Pune\n\u00a0Currently there are more than\u00a01200 companies\u00a0dealing in water and wastewater treatment in Maharashtra\n\nPune and Nashik are going to be the largest hub for manufacturing and fabrication industry in pumps, instrumentation and monitoring equipment\nNational Institute of Hydrology (NIH) undertakes R&D activities in the field of dam break flood studies, conservation storage of reservoirs, regulations of spillway gates, flood control regulations and forecasting, snow and glacier studies, water quality, groundwater assessment, remote sensing and GIS application\n\u00a0Other institutions involved are the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Central Water Commission (CWC), the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB)\n\n\nTest and measurement\n\nThe government has been introducing new technologies like aquifer-mapping programme through satellite data, round-the-clock monitoring systems, appointment of lake wardens, installation of flow meters, etc. for equitable supply and distribution of water and involving public in conservation efforts\nIt has also been decided that all residential group housing projects or apartments in the city with more than 20 units and total build-up area of 2,000 sqm will have to install STP\nThe Aurangabad City Water Utility Company Limited (ACWUCL) has installed the new flow meters at 39 different water distribution points in the city to check water pilferages and streamline the distribution of water from all distribution points in the city\nSince the installation of the system, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation has been able to save around 10 to 12 million liters of water per day\n\n\nSkill and training\n\nPoorly trained or untrained water/wastewater plant operators can undermine the proper functioning of the best designed treatment plants through negligent maintenance of mechanical systems, improper supervision of electrical systems, failure to respond appropriately to alarms and warnings, etc.\nWith the rural sanitation and water sector in India poised for change and with the new vision for the sector in the 12th Plan, the sector demands newer capacities, skills and orientation of those working in it\nNational Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) envisages providing multi-level cadre of adequate motivated skilled and trained personnel in rural water supply and sanitation sector\nIndia faces a shortage of skilled workers, and the government is committed to create skilled workforce of 500 million by 2022\nThe Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has listed around 20 of the country\u2019s most reputed educational and research institutes/universities as Key Resource Centre (KRCs), and around 20 NGOs, who are working towards water and sanitation sector in rural areas successfully\n\n\nGovernment initiatives\n\nThe state Government has made a budgetary allocation of \u00a0Rs\u00a0 988.2 crore in 2016-17 for implementation of 600 rural water supply schemes, augmentation of 500 pipe water supply projects, construction of 300 overhead tanks and 500 iron removal units\nThe Centre has allocated of Rs 12,517 crore (US$1.86 billion) to the Ministry of Water Resources in FY 2016-17\nThe Centre Allocation of Rs 9,000 crore (US$ 1.34 billion) in FY 2016-17\nSwachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign), the country\u2019s biggest drive to improve sanitation and cleanliness,US$ 3 billion has been \u00a0allocated for the Clean Ganga programme for the next 5 years\nAs per the Union budget 2016, all the 89 \u2018active\u2019 irrigation projects are to be placed under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme
